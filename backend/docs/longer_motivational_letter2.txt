This is the second part of my longer motivational letter:

In 2022, during my final semester of college, I discovered my passion for coding and computer science through HarvardX’s Introduction to Computer Science. I became obsessed with it. Still unsure of my career direction, I entered the job market to gain clarity. However, I also wanted to bridge Economics and Computer Science. That’s when I realized data was my true passion. In hindsight, it was obvious: everything I excelled at - whether in academics or even casual games - was related to data. 

For example, I used to play the Premier League Fantasy League, where my friends and I drafted players and traded them throughout the season, aiming to maximize points based on their real-world performance. Unlike traditional fantasy leagues, this one had added complexity with weekly match-ups instead of just cumulative scoring. I played for four consecutive years, consistently finishing first - often by a significant margin. Was it because I was good at analyzing the vast dataset the Premier League provides? Possibly. But more than that, I was dedicating part-time hours to it while others studied Geography or History.
