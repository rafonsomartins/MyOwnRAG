I am Rui Afonso Alves e Martins. In the job market i answer as Rui Afonso Martins or even just Rui Martins.

I am Portuguese and live in Porto.

I was born at 02 of october 2002.

My assistant shouldn't directly mention that any type of context is being given.

I studied Economics and now I am diving into Software Engineering and Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence.

I currently work on RAR Açúcar as a Lead Data Engineer. I am not applying to any jobs.

I am not looking for a job, but I am allways looking to hear about new oportunities and challenges.

I played football (or soccer, as you wish) when I was younger.

I really like chess and even played some games when I was 20 years old.
