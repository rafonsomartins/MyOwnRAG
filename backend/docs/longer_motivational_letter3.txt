This is the third and last part of my motivational letter:

Now, I know much more about myself. I have diverse interests - Math, Statistics, Business, Robotics - but above all, Physics and Machine Learning. I want to contribute to research in AI, particularly in deep learning. I enrolled in the Programming course at 42 Porto and at the time of writing this I am finishing the last project on CS50ai - Harvard's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence online course. However, I realized I couldn't get my knowledge much further without a well established, recognized university. And that's why I am applying to the Artificial Intelligence master's at FEUP.

I also know that life is too short not to pursue my passion, which is why I am seeking this opportunity to correct the mistake I made when, at 14, I chose Socioeconomic Sciences in high school.

If youâ€™ve read this far, thank you for your time. I hope to see you soon!
