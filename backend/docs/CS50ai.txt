CS50ai was a incredible course to take in this later stage of my coding journey.

I now have 3+ years of experience with Cand python.

I have 1+ year of work experience with coding, particularly data science and data engineering.

I feel like this is the perfect time for me to take this course and that 3 years from now I will be as gratefull for taking it as I am now for taking CS50x.
