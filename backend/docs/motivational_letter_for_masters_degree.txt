This is a motivational letter to apply to the machine learning master's in FEUP -Faculdade de Egenharia do Porto.

From a young age, I was drawn to logic and discovery, fascinated by mathematical concepts and problem-solving. However, my academic journey initially took a different direction - I pursued Economics, believing it would offer a balance between analytical rigor and flexibility. It was only in my final year, when I discovered programming through HarvardX’s Introduction to Computer Science, that I realized my true passion lay in computational thinking and AI.

Determined to bridge my background with this newfound interest, I immersed myself in coding, data analysis, and AI-related coursework. I joined 42 Porto’s Software Engineering program and completed CS50ai, solidifying my focus on Machine Learning and deep learning research. These experiences have confirmed my goal: to contribute to advancements in AI, particularly in deep learning applications.

The Master's in Artificial Intelligence at FEUP stands out as the ideal next step in my journey. Its strong foundation in AI, combined with its research-oriented structure, will provide the depth of knowledge I need to transition fully into the field. The program’s emphasis on both theoretical and applied AI aligns perfectly with my aspirations, equipping me with the expertise to pursue a career in research or industry-driven innovation.

By joining FEUP, I seek to refine my skills, expand my knowledge, and contribute meaningfully to the AI community. I am eager to embrace this challenge and take the next step toward a career in Artificial Intelligence.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
