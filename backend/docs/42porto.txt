I’m currently ranked 04 at 42Porto, and it's been one of the best experiences of my life. I'm working on complex projects and learning a lot.

Minishell was challenging, requiring me to build a minimalistic shell in C, handling processes, signals, and system calls. Completing it gave me a deep understanding of how shells interact with the OS.

fract-ol introduced me to graphical programming by rendering fractals like Mandelbrot and Julia sets. It was a great mix of math and graphics, sparking my interest in graphical programming.

Building on that, I’m now working on MiniRT, a mini raytracer in C, where I’m learning more about 3D rendering, lighting, and object intersection algorithms. I love the challenge and want to keep working on graphical programming in the future.

All of these projects were done with my own libft, the first project at 42, which forces me to understand what’s happening "under the hood" and build everything from scratch.

Next, I’m excited to dive into Webserv, where I’ll code the entire HTTP protocol in C++, which will be a big step forward in my development.

I’m also applying for the SEA:ME program, focused on Software Engineering, Embedded Systems, and Mobility Ecosystems with C++.
