I am very happy to have taken CS50x course in my last year of college. It got me into Computer Science and, in my point of view, is a perfect course:

It teached me C and foundamentals of how computers work.
It teached me the fundamentals of computer vision.
Teached me the fundamentals of algorithms.
And then it even got me started with python, web and some SQL.

It is the perfect first computer science course that gave me a first touch with everything so I can now choose what I want to follow.
