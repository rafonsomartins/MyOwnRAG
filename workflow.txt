Frontend (React) on Vercel:

Your React app is hosted on Vercel.
It sends requests to Vercel’s API routes (which are serverless functions).
Vercel’s API Routes (Serverless Functions):

You can use Vercel’s serverless functions (written in JavaScript or Python) to handle API routes directly in Vercel.
API routes in Vercel can communicate with your Flask backend (which you would host elsewhere, like Heroku, Railway, etc.) via HTTP.
Flask Backend (Hosted elsewhere):

Your Flask app will still be hosted on a platform like Heroku, Railway, or Render (since Vercel isn't ideal for Flask).
The Flask backend handles communication with the Gemini API and MongoDB.
Vercel → Flask Backend → Gemini API → MongoDB:

Vercel's API route acts as a middle layer between your React frontend and the Flask backend.
Flask interacts with the Gemini API and MongoDB (for RAG).
The response from the Gemini API is sent back through the Flask backend, and the Flask backend then sends the data to Vercel’s API route.
Frontend Displays Response:

Vercel’s API route then sends the response back to the React frontend (hosted on Vercel).
The React app displays the result to the user.
